What is an interpreter in Python?\n","  - An interpreter is a program that reads and runs code line by line. In Python, the interpreter executes each command directly without converting the entire code into machine language first."],"metadata":{"id":"ARVj0D4dKJf5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. We can't use them as variable names because they’re part of Python’s core syntax."],"metadata":{"id":"ZTYLvGewKe7M"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4.

Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  - Lists are mutable so you can dynamically manage elements and Tuples are immutable to ensure stability and hashability."],"metadata":{"id":"yVSNYoPULk3s"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","  - In Python, the == operator is used to compare the values of two objects and returns True if they are equal.\n","  - The is operator checks whether two variables refer to the exact same object in memory. Even if two objects have the same value, they might not be the same in memory, so is can return False."],"metadata":{"id":"1kJoabQNL2iZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","  - Logical operators are used to perform boolean logic in Python. They combine conditional statements and return True or False based on the logic applied."],"metadata":{"id":"Ylr2LU8tMlpM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. What is type casting in Python?\n","  - Type casting in Python refers to converting one data type into another. It allows developers to explicitly change the type of a variable."],"metadata":{"id":"0DQweROeMyuJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  - Implicit type casting is automatic—Python converts types during operations.\n","  - Explicit type casting is manual—you tell Python what type you want."],"metadata":{"id":"CIsN3C5lNOlM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","    - Conditional statements help programs make decisions based on different conditions. They allow the flow of execution to change depending on whether certain criteria are met."],"metadata":{"id":"bIYHxGzoODU5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. How does the elif statement work?\n","  - The elif statement stands for “else if” and is used to check multiple conditions one by one. It comes after an if statement and allows you to test another condition if the first one is false. If the elif condition is true, its block of code runs—otherwise, Python moves on."],"metadata":{"id":"CUNPv-wZOO0k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13.  What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  - The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat something, usually with a sequence like a list or range.\n","  - The while loop is used when the number of repetitions depends on a condition being true."],"metadata":{"id":"mxiAn1zgOjxH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","  - A while loop is ideal when the number of iterations isn’t known in advance and depends on a changing condition. For example, if we are writing a program that asks a user to enter a password until they get it right. You don’t know how many attempts it will take, so a while loop is proper for this condition."],"metadata":{"id":"i9cgms3iPFrc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#PRACTICAL QUESTIONS"],"metadata":{"id":"ioiRX0_zPpkj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")"],"metadata":{"id":"wzuU-UpwPykV","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754414260060,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"K S Sachin","userId":"11045712714080393064"}},"outputId":"21a33eeb-b6a4-4c5e-8806-1076544e68a2"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 2.
